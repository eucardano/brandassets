Dear speaker, 

If you are reading this you have been directly invited by us or you are on the verge to getting in touch with us.  
Either way we are thrilled to having you as a prospect for one of our Fireside Chats.  
Thank you for helping us to present your brand in the best way.  

Here is a introductional video (2 minutes): https://youtu.be/pDHTGvE_XsQ

#### Updates:
```
We are trying to get more conversation and value for founders into the format.  
Thus the initial presentation time has been shortened to around 2-5 minutes.  
This allows you to learn about the other speakers on the podium.
```

```
If you can add a little tip or experience you can share with fellow founders.  
We will try to extract it as a YouTube short.
````

After everyone has been introduced we'll hopp into the actual Fireside Chat. 
You can always refer to your project, now with the advantage of having more context. 


### What this is for

Please use the information below from this template to streamline our process.
If you have been invited then we did sent you the link to an issue. 
Simply add your information (logo, socials, onepager) there as a comment. 

If you are in doubt of how we will use the information just check one our latest videos at https://youtube.com/@eucardano .  

### Speaker

Let us know your name or how we should address you.  
We usually have a casual first name approach.

### Logo

Best would be a png or svg with these dimensions `width: 515px heigth 110px`.  
 

### Onepager

A **onepager** presentation slide `width 1920 x height 1080px` is your perfect opportunity to add some visual information to your talk/presentation.  
To keep the conversational flow, we won't enable screensharing or longer presentations.  

We will implement the slide to our slidedeck latest on presentation day 12CET.
Everything after that is not guaranteed to be included in the presentation.   


### Socials
