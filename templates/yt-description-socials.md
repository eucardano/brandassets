Either way we are thrilled to having you as a prospect for one of our Fireside Chats.  
Thank you for helping us to present your brand in the best way.  

### What this is for

Please use the information below from this template to streamline our process.
If you have been invited then we did sent you the link to an issue. 
Simply add your information (logo, socials, onepager) there as a comment. 

If you are in doubt of how we will use the information just check one our latest videos at https://youtube.com/@eucardano .  

### Logo

Best would be a png or svg with these dimensions `width: 515px heigth 110px`.  
 

### Onepager

A **onepager** presentation slide `width 1920 x height 1080px` is your perfect opportunity to add some visual information to your talk/presentation.  
We will implement it latest on presentation day 12CET.
Everything after that is not guaranteed to be included in the presentation.   


### Socials

We also add your socials to the YT video and our X/Twitter posts.  
Please remove those parts you don't need.
