# NFTweekends

NFTweekends offer a streamlined way to attract new community members through giveaway events on social media.
These recurring events allow NFT projects to expand their outreach through promotional giveaways via our community account.
The advantage on our side is the replicable post setup, which can be scheduled months in advance, easing the workload for the social media manager.

This initiative has **accelerated the growth of our Discord server and X account** and has the potential to be replicated to **increase engagement on our YouTube videos** as well.


## Tools being used

1. X and/or Bluesky (Twitter)
2. Discord
3. Pool.pm (For asset request and asset image)
4. Cardano wallet

## Basic Rules

It's worth noting that giveaway participants are **mainly project followers, NFT enthusiasts, or fortune hunters** looking to flip NFTs quickly on secondary markets.  
We have experimented with different engagement strategies, but the simplest version - **follow**, **like**, **repost**, and **comment your favorite project** — has yielded the best results.  

This suggests that NFT hunters are generally **less inclined** to contribute meaningful content to your community through these types of events.  
As a result, giveaways are best viewed as a **tool for boosting basic growth metrics**, though they may decrease the depth of engagement that a truly involved community fosters.  

That said, while giveaways primarily enhance cosmetic metrics, they are far from useless—quite the opposite.  
When **strategically tied** to other events, giveaways can **increase cross-promotion** opportunities and boost engagement within social media algorithms.  
Additionally, on a **psychological level**, a larger follower count enhances credibility and attraction.  

If your community is **highly engaged yet niche**, you may still leverage NFT giveaways to **gather valuable insights** (e.g., design tests, polls, or voting mechanisms).
