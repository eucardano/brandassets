# X-Space preparation

A simple guide on how we organize X-Spaces in different local languages in the European Union.

----
## Introduction
- All the X-Space are hosted by the **European Cardano Community** (*EU-Cardano*)
- Topics are held by the official *Regional co-hosts* who will drive the conversation. There can by a maximum of two co-hosts per X-Space
- Official banners and announcements are created by *EU-Cardano*.


## Preparation
- The *Regional co-hosts* will prepare a list of topics that they plan to discuss during the space.
- The *Regional co-hosts* and *EU-Cardano* will decide the date/time of the event
- The *EU-Cardano* will create the space on X, and generate the official banner image
- The first announcement should be done by *EU-Cardano* about 5 to 7 days before the event, in the local language, with a repost done the day before the event. More reposts are always welcome.
- *EU-Cardano* will start the space a few minutes before the planned time, to give the co-host rights to the *Regional co-hosts*
- *EU-Cardano* will them mute the phone on which the space has been started. In case the operator from *EU-Cardano* is interested in joining the space as a *speaker*, that would be better done a personal account on a different device.
- The *Regional co-hosts* will message the operator from *EU-Cardano* to close the space
